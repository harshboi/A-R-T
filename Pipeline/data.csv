"The abused target: Windows OS uses a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program. Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a malicious DLL, a technique known as DLL search order hijacking (or binary planting).";1;4223
"The abused app: FaceFodUninstaller.exe. It exists on a clean OS installation starting from Windows 10 RS4 (1803) at the    %WINDR%\System32\WinBioPlugIns   folder. The executable is dependent on winbio.dll, which is usually found in the parent directory (   %WINDR%\System32  ) pic.twitter.com/lEA0hU";1;4222
"What makes this executable even more attractive in the eyes of an attacker is the fact that it is started from a built-in scheduled task named FODCleanupTask, minimizing the footprint on the machine and reducing chances of detection. pic.twitter.com/Gn9N18RvpN";2;4221
